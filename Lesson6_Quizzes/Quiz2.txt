Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

 appendChild()
 insertBefore()
The difference is that the node added with appendChild() is always appended after any existing child nodes. The insertBefore() method allows you to specify the order of the inserted
node among its sibling nodes.

2.  List the six main objects that make up the browser object model. 
Screen Objects, Location Objects, History Objects, Document Objects, Navigator Objects, and Window Objects.
